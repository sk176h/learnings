##	Key Benefits of using Specification By Example


### Scenario and Challenges of Today

+ What is really happening to software development today 

	* Speed is the need of the day in this world of internet

	* Gone are the days of code freezes and weeks of regression testing
	
	* Project schedules are normally reduced to months 
	
	* People do not want to spend weeks in upfront planning , rather project phases are reduced to weeks

	* Software is built in iterations , is everchanging and requirements are unpredictable



+ So what happens to project documentation due to this	
	
	* No time to maintain documentation
	
	* Easily gets lagged with the increased speed of delivery 
	
	* Overhead incurred in maintenance of documentation

	* Outdated documentation often causes confusion to testers and business analysts

	* Test plans are a type of documentation too and keeping them updated as software changes is a challenge



+ How software development paradigms are changing

	* The traditional focus has been on building the software right 

	* However we also need to make sure that we are building the right software. i.e. software that suits its intended purpose

	* Both are required to be accomplished to succeed



+ What is needed to build the right software in an effective way 

	* Teams understand precisely what is required and can measure what is being built against what is required

	* Teams need to define when to stop and call a feature 100% complete 

	* Teams need precise documentation that would possibly keep up with the pace of software development

	* Avoid efforts spent in overplanning and overengineering



+ What is *Specification by Example*
	
	* In simple words it is a set of processes patterns that help teams build the right s/w product 

	* It is suitable for agile development projects although non agile projects also have reported benefits from using Specification By Example 



+ In what ways does Specification By Example help teams 
	
	* **Implementing Changes More Effectively**	
	* **Highier Product Quality** 
	* **Less Rework**
	* **Better allignment of activities of different roles on a project**


### Implementing changes more effectively

* Living Documentation

	+ Living documentation is a source of information about the system functionality that is as reliable as a programming language but much easier to access and understand 

	+  Allows teams to collaboratively analyze the impact of proposed changes and discuss solutions 

	+  Enables capture of specilists knowledge about the business process and make it instantly available to all the team members


### Highier product quality

  
### Less time rework 

* Teams implementing Specification by Example generally get it correct in the first attempt

* They are at less risk of discovering at the end of iteration that they build something that was not expected

* Less danger of polluting the code base 

* Using specification by example to make requirements more precise at the start of development cycle make it easier to manage product backlogs

##  Key Process Patterns to Implementing Specification by Example

---

The key process patterns that help teams practice Specification by Example are 

* 	Deriving Scope From Goals
* 	Specifying Collaboratively
* 	Illustraing using examples
* 	Refining the specifications

### Deriving Scope From Goals

In a development team the business owners specify their requirements and the development teams expects them to provide them
with concise and clear business requirements

The development team members do not normally participate in any of the process before the requirements are defined and thus 
miss on a key aspect of the goals of the project 

The development team  entirely relies on the customer team to give them user stories , use cases or other relevant information 
and thus indirectly rely on the customer team to provide a business solution 

There is an inhererent flaw in this process because the customers do not know to design a solution 

When the customers define the scope entirely the project does not benefit from the knowledge of the development team 

Sucessful dev teams that use Specification by Example do this differently

Instead of just relying on the customers to provide user stories dev teams collaborate with the customers to *derive the scope from goals*

They start with the customers goals and then they collaborate with the customers to derive the scope from the goals 

Customer teams specify intent and goals and the development teams suggest a solution that is faster cheaper and easier to maintain

### Specifying Collaboratively

Communication is one of the most difficult things in the software development process.

If developers and testers are not engaged in designing specific solutions for the business the requirements or user stories 
have to be communicated separately to the team. 

This leads to miscommunication , details getting lost in translation. As a consequence business users have to validate the software after delivery and teams have to go back and change if validations fail 

The process benefits from people coming from different backgrounds. 
e.g.

* Technical experts can discuss how to best implemnent the solution effectively 

* Testers know where to look for potential issues and how the team should work to prevent those issues 

Specifying collaboratively enables us to harness the knowledge and experience of the whole team. It creates collective ownership of specifications

### Illustraing using examples

Natural language is ambiguous and context dependent and efforts have to be made by developers and testers to understand requirements or user stories written in natural language 

Small differences in understanding requirements have a cumulative effect leading to problems that require rework after delivery which leads to unnecessary delays 

Instead of waiting for specifications to be expressed in terms of programming language , which only the developers understand successful teams *illustrate specifications using examples* 

Developers and testers help define these examples and suggest additonal examples that illustrate the edge cases and address the areas of the system that are particularly problematic 

If the system works as per the specifications then it is considered to be done 

Further if the specifications are easy to understand and communicate , they can be effectively used as unambiguous and detailed requirements


### Refining the Specifications
