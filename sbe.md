### Scenario and Challenges of Today

+ What is really happening to software development today 

	* Speed is the need of the day in this world of internet

	* Gone are the days of code freezes and weeks of regression testing
	
	* Project schedules are normally reduced to months 
	
	* People do not want to spend weeks in upfront planning , rather project phases are reduced to weeks

	* Software is built in iterations , is everchanging and requirements are unpredictable



+ So what happens to project documentation due to this	
	
	* No time to maintain documentation
	
	* Easily gets lagged with the increased speed of delivery 
	
	* Overhead incurred in maintenance of documentation

	* Outdated documentation often causes confusion to testers and business analysts

	* Test plans are a type of documentation too and keeping them updated as software changes is a challenge



+ How software development paradigms are changing

	* The traditional focus has been on building the software right 

	* However we also need to make sure that we are building the right software. i.e. software that suits its intended purpose

	* Both are required to be accomplished to succeed



+ What is needed to build the right software in an effective way 

	* Teams understand precisely what is required and can measure what is being built against what is required

	* Teams need to define when to stop and call a feature 100% complete 

	* Teams need precise documentation that would possibly keep up with the pace of software development

	* Avoid efforts spent in overplanning and overengineering



+ What is *Specification by Example*
	
	* In simple words it is a set of processes patterns that help teams build the right s/w product 

	* It is suitable for agile development projects although non agile projects also have reported benefits from using Specification By Example 



+ In what ways does Specification By Example help teams 
	
	* **Implementing Changes More Effectively**	
	* **Highier Product Quality** 
	* **Less Rework**
	* **Better allignment of activities of different roles on a project**


### Implementing changes more effectively

* Living Documentation

	+ Living documentation is a source of information about the system functionality that is as reliable as a programming language but much easier to access and understand 

	+  Allows teams to collaboratively analyze the impact of proposed changes and discuss solutions 

	+  Enables capture of specilists knowledge about the business process and make it instantly available to all the team members


### Highier product quality
