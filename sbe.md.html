<h3>Scenario and Challenges of Today</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>What is really happening to software development today </p>

<ul>
<li>Speed is the need of the day in this world of internet</li>
<li>Gone are the days of code freezes and weeks of regression testing</li>
<li>Project schedules are normally reduced to months </li>
<li>People do not want to spend weeks in upfront planning , rather project phases are reduced to weeks</li>
<li>Software is built in iterations , is everchanging and requirements are unpredictable</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>So what happens to project documentation due to this  </p>

<ul>
<li>No time to maintain documentation</li>
<li>Easily gets lagged with the increased speed of delivery </li>
<li>Overhead incurred in maintenance of documentation</li>
<li>Outdated documentation often causes confusion to testers and business analysts</li>
<li>Test plans are a type of documentation too and keeping them updated as software changes is a challenge</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How software development paradigms are changing</p>

<ul>
<li>The traditional focus has been on building the software right </li>
<li>However we also need to make sure that we are building the right software. i.e. software that suits its intended purpose</li>
<li>Both are required to be accomplished to succeed</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is needed to build the right software in an effective way </p>

<ul>
<li>Teams understand precisely what is required and can measure what is being built against what is required</li>
<li>Teams need to define when to stop and call a feature 100% complete </li>
<li>Teams need precise documentation that would possibly keep up with the pace of software development</li>
<li>Avoid efforts spent in overplanning and overengineering</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is <em>Specification by Example</em></p>

<ul>
<li>In simple words it is a set of processes patterns that help teams build the right s/w product </li>
<li>It is suitable for agile development projects although non agile projects also have reported benefits from using Specification By Example </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In what ways does Specification By Example help teams </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Implementing Changes More Effectively</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Highier Product Quality</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Less Rework</strong></li>
<li><strong>Better allignment of activities of different roles on a project</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementing changes more effectively</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Living Documentation</p>

<ul>
<li>Living documentation is a source of information about the system functionality that is as reliable as a programming language but much easier to access and understand </li>
<li> Allows teams to collaboratively analyze the impact of proposed changes and discuss solutions </li>
<li> Enables capture of specilists knowledge about the business process and make it instantly available to all the team members</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Highier product quality</h3>

<h3>Less time rework</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Teams implementing Specification by Example generally get it correct in the first attempt</p></li>
<li><p>They are at less risk of discovering at the end of iteration that they build something that was not expected</p></li>
<li><p>Less danger of polluting the code base </p></li>
<li><p>Using specification by example to make requirements more precise at the start of development cycle make it easier to manage product backlogs</p></li>
</ul>
